Baptism of fire
Be fruitful and multiply.
Beat swords into plowshares.
Bite the dust
Blessed are the peacemakers.
Born again
Breath of life
By the skin of your teeth
Can a leopard change its spots?
Cast bread upon the waters.
Cast the first stone.
Charity begins at home.
Coat of many colors
Don't cast your pearls before swine.
Dust to dust
